# Javascript Quiz

This is a Harry Potter themed quiz done with Javascript. The aim was to create a quiz with 20 questions. Each question has four possible answers. The quiz calculates the user's score when they press submit and displays their score back to them including a message of either encouragement or congratulations depending on their score.
